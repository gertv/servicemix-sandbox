Welcome to Apache ServiceMix 4 
==============================
Apache ServiceMix is an open source ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) that combines 
the functionality of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and an Event Driven
Architecture (EDA)  to create an agile, enterprise ESB.

Apache ServiceMix is an open source distributed ESB built from the ground up on 
the  Java Business Integration (JBI) specification JSR 208 and released under 
the Apache license. The goal of JBI is to allow components and services to be 
integrated in a vendor independent way, allowing users and vendors to plug and 
play.
