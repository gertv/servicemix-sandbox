Building Apache ServiceMix 4
============================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE 5.0 SDK, which can be downloaded from 
   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp. Use version of 1.5.0_06 JDK.

2) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly installed 
   JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or 
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

3) Install Maven 2.0.8, which can be downloaded from 
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes 
   the MVN_HOME/bin directory. 


Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of Apache ServiceMix 4 source distribution.
2) Run
         $> mvn
   This will compile Apache ServiceMix 4 and run all of the tests in the 
   Apache ServiceMix Kernel source distribution. Alternatively, you can run
         $> mvn -Pfastinstall
   This will compile Apache ServiceMix 4 without running the tests and takes less
   time to build.
   Depending on the load of remote Maven 2.0 repositories, you may have 
   to run "mvn" several times until the required dependencies are 
   all located in your local maven repository. It usually takes some time for 
   maven to download required dependencies in the first build.
3) The distributions will be available under "assembly/target" directory.
