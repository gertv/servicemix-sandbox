                  Apache ServiceMix 4.0
                  ================================
 Overview
 --------

Apache ServiceMix 4.0 is the first release of our OSGi based integration platform.  It includes two major components:
- Apache ServiceMix Kernel 1.1.0
  an OSGi runtime with a lot of extra features (SSH connectivity, provisioning enhancements, Spring integration, ...)
- Apache ServiceMix NMR 1.0.0
  an OSGi based NMR and JBI container, which also comes with a new clustering engine ready for enterprise deployment

In addition, ServiceMix 4.0 also ships with enhanced ActiveMQ, Camel and CXF integration as well as a whole set of
examples to let you leverage this functionality.  We also have out-of-the-box support for deploying and running web
applications, so they can run together with everything else in the same container.
