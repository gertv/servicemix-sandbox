Welcome to the ServiceMix camel osgi example
==========================================

This example demonstrates using Apache Camel to deploy EIP routes in
Servicemix.
Also this example shows how to use osgi propertie placeholder and how to
deploy the properties file from console.

Quick steps to install the sample
---------------------------------

Launch the ServiceMix Kernel by running
  bin/servicemix
in the root dir of this distribution.

When inside the console, if you haven't already done so, addUrls for the
nmr and kernel features:
  features/addUrl mvn:org.apache.servicemix.nmr/apache-servicemix-nmr/${servicemix.nmr.version}/xml/features
  features/addUrl mvn:org.apache.servicemix.features/apache-servicemix/${version}/xml/features

Next install the examples-camel-osgi feature:
  features/install examples-camel-osgi

If you have all the bundles available in your local repo, the installation
of the example will be very fast, otherwise it may take some time to
download everything needed.

Testing the example
-------------------

Once the example feature is installed, periodic events are routed to the
transform method of the MyTransform class which prints output to the 
console: 
>>>> MyTransform set body:  Tue Jun 10 16:56:47 NDT 2008
>>>> JavaDSL set body: Tue Jun 10 16:56:47 NDT 2008

You can view the route configuration in META-INF/spring/beans.xml.

Finally, uninstall the examples-camel-osgi feature:
  features/uninstall examples-camel-osgi

As well, you can view ExampleRouter log entries in the ServiceMix log:
  log/d

You also can update and redeploy properties file which is used by the properties
placeholder in the beans.xml from console.

Edit the org.apache.servicemix.examples.cfg in this folder, change the
value of key "prefix" whatever you want(for example YourTransform), then in
the console 
exec cp
$YOUR_SERVICEMIX_HOME/examples/camel-osgi/org.apache.servicemix.examples.cfg
$YOUR_SERVICEMIX_HOME/etc

For Windows user, if you don't install the cigwin, you may need to change the cp command to xcopy or cmd /c copy.
exec xcopy
%YOUR_SERVICEMIX_HOME%\\examples\\camel-osgi\\org.apache.servicemix.examples.cfg %YOUR_SERVICEMIX_HOME%\\etc
 
And then stop and start the bundle of this example which name is "Apache ServiceMix Example :: Camel OSGi", you can use "osgi list"to get this bundle id.
Then you should find the prefix of the output should like
>>>> YourTransform set body:  Tue Jun 10 16:56:47 NDT 2008
>>>> JavaDSL set body: Tue Jun 10 16:56:47 NDT 2008

How does it work?
-----------------

The installation leverages ServiceMix Kernel by installing what's called
'features'. You can see the features definition file using the following
command inside the ServiceMix console:

cat mvn:org.apache.servicemix.features/apache-servicemix/${version}/xml/features

The list of available features can be obtained using:

features/list
