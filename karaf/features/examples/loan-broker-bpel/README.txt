Welcome to the Servicemix Loan Broker example
=============================================

This example is based on the great EIP book 
(http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ComposedMessagingExample.html).
It leverages the BPEL service engine, JMS binding component and some 
lightweight components provided by ServiceMix.

First start a ServiceMix server (if not already started) by running
  bin/servicemix
in the root dir of this ditribution.

This example depends on Apache Ode JBI Service Engine which has not been
released yet.  You will need to build it yourself (more informations at
http://incubator.apache.org/ode/getting-ode.html).  You will need to copy
the Service Engine installer to the install directory of this distribution
prior to the following instructions.

To run this sample, launch the following commands:
  mvn install

You can deploy the example on ServiceMix 4 in two different ways:
- using hotdeploy: 
   copy the loan-broker-sa/target/loan-broker-sa-${version}.zip to <servicemix_home>/deploy
- using the ServiceMix console:
   osgi/install -s mvn:org.apache.servicemix.examples.loan-broker/loan-broker-sa/${version}/zip

To test this sample, launch the following commands:
  ant run
