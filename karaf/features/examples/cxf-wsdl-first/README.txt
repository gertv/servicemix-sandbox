Welcome to ServiceMix WSDL design first example
===============================================

This example shows how to expose a service in servicemix-cxf-se, beginning from the
WSDL, and exposing it over servicemix-cxf-bc.

First start a ServiceMix server (if not already started) by running
  bin/servicemix
in the root dir of this distribution.

To run this sample, launch the following commands:
  mvn install

You can deploy the example on ServiceMix 4 in two different ways:
- using hotdeploy: 
   copy the wsdl-first-cxf-sa/target/wsdl-first-cxf-sa-${version}.zip to <servicemix_home>/deploy
- using the ServiceMix console:
   osgi/install -s mvn:org.apache.servicemix.examples.cxf-wsdl-first/wsdl-first-cxf-sa/${version}/zip

You can browse the WSDL at
  http://localhost:8092/PersonService?wsdl
  
You can also open the client.html page in a browser
to send a request to the service.
Or you can launch a java client to send request
cd client; mvn compile exec:java
