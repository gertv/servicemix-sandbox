Welcome to the ServiceMix cxf osgi example
==========================================

This example leverages CXF and Spring-DM to create a web service and expose
it through the OSGi HTTP Service.

Quick steps to install the sample
---------------------------------

Launch the ServiceMix Kernel by running
  bin/servicemix
in the root dir of this distribution.

When inside the console, just run the following commands to install the
example:

  features/addUrl mvn:org.apache.servicemix.nmr/apache-servicemix-nmr/${servicemix.nmr.version}/xml/features
  features/addUrl mvn:org.apache.servicemix.features/apache-servicemix/${version}/xml/features
  features/install examples-cxf-osgi

If you have all the bundles available in your local repo, the installation
of the example will be very fast, otherwise it may take some time to
download everything needed.

Testing the example
-------------------

When the feature is installed, output for publishing the cxf endpoint
is displayed to the console.

Now, just open your browser and go to the following url:

http://localhost:8181/cxf/HelloWorld?wsdl

It should display the WSDL of the service (if you use Safari, make sure to
right click the window and select 'Show Source', else the page will be blank).
Or you can also test it from ServiceMix console using"

optional/cat http://localhost:8181/cxf/HelloWorld?wsdl

You can also open the client.html page in a browser to try sending a request
to the service.

Or you can launch java code client to send the request
mvn compile exec:java

How does it work?
-----------------

The installation leverages ServiceMix Kernel by installing what's called
'features'. You can see the features definition file using the following
command inside ServiceMix console:

optional/cat mvn:org.apache.servicemix.features/apache-servicemix/${version}/xml/features

The list of available features can be obtained using:

features/list
