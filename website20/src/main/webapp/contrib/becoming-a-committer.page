# Becoming a Committer

First of all you need to get involved and [contribute](/contrib/index.html) via the mail list, forum, issue tracker and submit patches.

Once you're contributing and your work is good, one of our [team](/community/team.html) might invite you to be a committer (after we've called a vote). When that happens, if you accept, the following process kicks into place...

## Steps to becoming a committer

1. Download and print the Apache Contributor License Agreement(CLA) from [here](http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html).
1. Sign it and fax it to Apache. In the past I've found its often faster to also post it via snail mail![smile](images/smile.gif).
1. Wait for your name to appear on the list of [received CLAs](http://people.apache.org/~jim/committers.html#unlistedclas").
1. Once thats done let us know and we can apply to Apache Infrastructure to have your account created; we'll also need to know:
    * your full name
    * your preferred email address
    * your preferred unix account name

## Getting started at Apache

First add yourself to the [team](/community/team.html) page.</p>

Now go read the instructions on the [new committers guide](http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html). Its also worth viewing [http://www.apache.org/dev](http://www.apache.org/dev).

## Enabling your SVN account

Once you've got your Apache account working you need to enable SVN access; See this document for details of using **svnpasswd**:

## Configuring SVN

You should follow [this guide](http://www.apache.org/dev/svn-eol-style.txt) to setup your EOL settings.
