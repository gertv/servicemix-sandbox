# Guidelines for Committers

This page serves as a gather spot for all information for committers to Apache ServiceMix. It is requested that all committers comply with the following guidelines.

## Code Style

Before committing anything, please see the [coding standards](coding-standards.html).

These code standards are enforced in most ares of the codebase via the [maven-checkstyle-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) and the [maven-pmd-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/). Just make sure to build your code before committing.


## Subversion Client Configuration

Please see the [Subversion client EOL configuration](http://www.apache.org/dev/svn-eol-style.txt).

## Documentation

* All major commits **must** be associated with a JIRA issue.
    * The commit log should begin with the JIRA issue number. For a good example, see this [Log Message](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=582756).
    * If there are multiple commits for a JIRA issue, each commit log should begin with the JIRA issue number.
* All committed code **must** be properly documented.
    * If you are working on a piece of code that is undocumented or poorly documented, please take the time to document it properly before committing!
    * This includes Javadoc and regular comments. If you need an example of good documentation, take a peek at the [Spring source code](http://springframework.cvs.sourceforge.net/springframework/spring/src/org/springframework/). Here is the [Spring ``AbstractJmsListeningContainer``](http://springframework.cvs.sourceforge.net/springframework/spring/src/org/springframework/jms/listener/AbstractJmsListeningContainer.java?view=markup).

## Unit Tests

* All major code additions and changes should be accompanied by a unit test.

    This allows all issues to be proven in future builds.</LI>
* Unit tests should provide as much coverage as possible.

    The goal is to cover 100% of the codebase. This is enforced much easier on ServiceMix 4.0 than the existing ServiceMix 3.0 codebase.</LI>

## Licensing and Copyright

* All new source file submissions **must** include the Apache License in a comment at the head of the file.

    Below is an example for use in Java files. Other file types may need to change the comment style.

* All contributions **must** comply with the terms of the [Apache Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/cla.pdf).
* Any questions about copyright or patent issues should be raised on the dev mailing list **before** contributing or committing code.

## Miscellaneous

* If you need to experiment with something and you want to commit your code, just create a branch in the Subversion repo.
* If you are troubleshooting a problem, stop to create a unit test first. Then you'll have something to commit.
