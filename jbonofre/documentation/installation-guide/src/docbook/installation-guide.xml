        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            Apache ServiceMix is an open source ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) that combines the functionality of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
            and an Event Driven Architecture (EDA) to create an agile, enterprise ESB.
        </para>
        <para>
            Apache ServiceMix is an distributed ESB built from the ground up on the Java Business Integration (JBI) specification JSR 208 and released
            under the Apache license. The goal of JBI is to allow components and services to be integrated in a vendor independent way, allowing users 
            and vendors to plug and play.
        </para>
        <para>
            ServiceMix is lightweight and easily embeddable, has integrated Spring support and can be run at the edge of the network (inside a client
            or server), as a standalone ESB provider or as a service within another ESB. You can use ServiceMix in Java SE or Java EE application server.
        </para>
        <para>
            ServiceMix uses ActiveMQ to provide remoting, clustering, reliability and distributed failover.
        </para>
        <para>
            ServiceMix is completely integrated into Apache Geronimo, which allows you to deploy JBI components and services directly into Geronimo.
            ServiceMix is being JBI certified as part of the Geronimo project.
        </para>
        <para>
            ServiceMix can be embedded into a JEE application server such as JBoss, Oracle Weblogic or IBM Websphere.
        </para>
        <para>
            ServiceMix includes a complete JBI container supporting all parts of the JBI specification including:

                <listitem><para>JBI Management MBeans</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>full support for the JBI deployment units with hot-deployment of JBI components.</para>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>
            ServiceMix also provides a simple to use client API for working with JBI components and services.
        </para>
        <para>
            ServiceMix includes many JBI components including HTTP, JMX, CXF, BPEL, etc.
