                  Apache ServiceMix Kernel 1.0.0
                  ==============================

Overview
--------

This 1.0.0 version of Apache ServiceMix Kernel provides a stable and efficient platform to build 
OSGi based applications.  It provides the following features:
  * a local or remote shell console for inspecting the installed OSGi applications, viewing the logs,
    viewing files, starting and stopping OSGi bundles and lots of other nice features.  Commands can be
    added at runtime by deploying new bundles in the Kernel.
  * the file deployer allows the deployment of plain Spring-DM configuration files, exploded or plain 
    bundles.  Other types of artifacts can be handled by extending the deployer at runtime.
  * security support for deploying keystores used for SSL connections or new user realms for securing
    applications access.
  * a simple, yet powerful, provisioning system that allows a whole application to be installed in a single
    command line using a simple xml descriptor that also embeds some configuration data
    
Changelog
---------
    
The following list shows the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release:

** Bug
    * [SMX4KNL-34] - snapshot jar name mismatch in startup.properties and in the system folder
    * [SMX4KNL-52] - Deployment of pain spring files does not work when using xml extensions because these are not available in the classpath
    * [SMX4KNL-53] - During starting, files are redeployed several times, one each time a new Deployer is registered in OSGi
    * [SMX4KNL-54] - Kernel does not start if system property "felix.cache.profiledir" is not defined
    * [SMX4KNL-56] - Kernel does not start on Windows if classpath contains spaces
    * [SMX4KNL-58] - Hot-deploy capability of FileMonitor does not update bundles properly on Windows.

** Improvement
    * [SMX4KNL-51] - Add a configuration file for the maven url handler so that adding default repositories is easy enough
    * [SMX4KNL-55] - Use maven shade plugin on the main module so that sources jar is correct


** Task
    * [SMX4KNL-57] - Extract bundles from the svn tree
    * [SMX4KNL-59] - Upgrade to spring 2.5.5 / spring-dm 1.1.0



                  Apache ServiceMix Kernel 1.0-rc1
                  ================================

This first Release Candidate of Apache ServiceMix Kernel includes a security framework based on
JAAS allowing authentication using JAAS realms deployed at runtime and also allow keystores and
trustores to be deployed and accessed through OSGi.  This allow the remote console to be secured
correctly (if the console is activated in a production environment, we strongly recommand to 
deploy a custom JAAS realm and new keystores when using the SSL connection).  A few bugs have been
fixed too.

A release candidate (RC) is a distribution that has not been proven completely stable, but the 
feature set is the one that will be available in the final release.   The number of RCs has not 
been fixed and it will depend on the feedback we obtain from this release, so please give it a try
and report any problems you can find.

    * [SMX4KNL-45] - The "log display" command does not display anything when running from an instance that has been created using the "admin create" command

    * [SMX4KNL-48] - ulimit error on MacOS X Leopard 10.5
