Welcome to the ServiceMix WS-Security Example
=============================================

This example shows how to secure JBI endpoints.

To start this sample, run:
  mvn jbi:embeddedServicemix

You will find two html client pages you can use to send
requests to ServiceMix.
  * client-basic.html uses basic http authentication
  * client-ws-sec.html uses ws-sec username token to provide credentials
