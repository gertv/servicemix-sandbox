	<h2> GWT Shell Demo </h2>
    <p>
       
        Ideally this page would be a cool little web based admin GUI for the ServiceMix 4 runtime.  But since that does not exist yet,
        this static page is all you get.<br/>  
        <br/>
        But don't fear, just press '~' (the tilda key), to bring up a cool little command line interface that
        can access the ServiceMix command line.  This will remain a permanent feature of the ServiceMix admin GUI so that
        hard core admins can always easily access all the servicemix commands even over the web.
